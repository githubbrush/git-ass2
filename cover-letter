Dear Reader,

By looking at ideologies and principles of InkPaper.ai, it has interested me in applying for the position of Cloud/DevOps Engineer at your company. As an ambitious Cloud/DevOps engineer with a healthy passion for this position, I truly believe that working at your company will be an exciting and enriching experience.

I have three years of work dedicated to the field of Infrastructure and cloud development in a product-based company (Netbrain Technologies) and a top-ranking financial organization in the country (Royal Bank of Canada). Besides, I have developed experience in handling the challenging and rewarding work that the position requires. I have, in all these years, gained experience in the:

Providing cloud solutions, implementing security application practices, Fabricating CI/CD processes, managing containers, and automating tasks related to Linux and Windows systems. Concentrating on Amazon Web Services (AWS) in particular.

The main achievements that I have managed to complete in my previous job, which might help in handling the work of an Infrastructure Cloud Engineer in your company, are:
1)Key member in launching the entire Netbrain Automated network solution in the AWS environment using Terraform as IaC in the USA region.
2)Boosted sales of the product after we deployed our solution. Saw a growth in future opportunities by landing a contract to provide this solution in Europe.
3)I have designed the solution in a form that can be launched in any region within a few minutes with resiliency, safety, and high availability in mind.

I am a good communicator, so I enjoy working in a team and producing results as a part of the team. I also enjoy working independently as and when required of myself. I am a Keen person to learn new technologies and follow industry trends.

I hope you will consider arranging an interview with me.

Thanking you,
